Project name: 
	Automated Checkout Assistant
	
	
Description:
	This checkout automation assistant is a python program designed to
	streamline the online shopping experience by automating the checkout process. 
	Leveraging the powerful Selenium library, this program offers seamless navigation
	through e-commerce websites, filling in necessary details, and completing 
	purchases efficiently.
	
	***NOTE***
	Please note that the use of the Selenium Python functions to automate 
	interactions with public websites may potentially violate the terms 
	of use or terms of service of those websites. Many websites explicitly 
	prohibit or restrict the use of automation tools for browsing or 
	interacting with their services.
	
	Unauthorized automation may result in actions taken against your account,
	including suspension or termination of access to the website's services.
	
	By using the Automated Checkout Assistant program, you acknowledge and accept
	the risks associated with automated interactions and agree to use the program
	responsibly and in accordance with all applicable terms and regulations. 
	The developer of the program shall not be held liable for any misuse or 
	consequences arising from the use of this program.
	

Installation:
Requirments:
Python Installation: 
	Ensure you have Python installed on your system. 
	You can download and install Python from the official website: python.org.

Selenium Library Installation: 
	Install the Selenium library for Python. You can do this using pip, Python's
	package installer, by running the following command in your terminal or 
	command prompt:
		"pip install selenium"

ChromeDriver Executable Download: 
	Download the ChromeDriver executable compatible with your Chrome browser 
	version. ChromeDriver is necessary for Selenium to automate interactions 
	with the Chrome browser.

Usage:
	***
	This specific program preforms automation on a website that will not 
	be disclosed for security reasons.
	Consequently; Running this code will result in an error
	
	Within the program there are functions defined to simplify the automation
	process which can be used for general purpose

	***NOTE***
	This program serves as an educational tool primarily aimed at learning 
	automation techniques using Selenium in Python. It is best utilized for 
	understanding and practicing automation functions within a controlled 
	environment, such as implementing them on your own website or target platform.
	
	While the program demonstrates the capabilities of Selenium and provides a 
	foundation for building automated processes, it is essential to use it 
	responsibly and ethically. By experimenting with the program in your own 
	environment, you can gain valuable insights into the automation workflow 
	and tailor it to suit your specific needs and target website.


Execution:
To run the program open a command prompt and execute the checkoutAutomation.py
	type: python automatedCheckoutAssitant.py
